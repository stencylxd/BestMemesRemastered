<p> this meme originated in febuary 2020 when Grandayy announced it the meme of the month. the lego city meme was about a new ad for the lego city rescue helicopter set. people started making memes about it, rearranging the words around, putting words from other lego city ads in them, etc. the meme started dying at the end of the month and poeple made memes about a man has died in lego city. the dialouge for this meme is, "A man has fallen into the river in Lego city! start the new rescue helicopter!" "HEY" "Build the helicopter and off to the rescue! prepare the lifeline, lower the strecher, and make the rescue! the new emergency collection from lego city! </p>
